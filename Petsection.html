	<p>So I have two inside pets and a single outside pet. The outside pet does it's 
	own thing and we basically just feed it and give it water.
	You can deside if it's our pet or not. Razz our dog, loves peanut-butter, and we generally
	put some in his bone as a challenge treat. Occasionally we might put a treat
	inside his bone, and then put his bone inside his small tire that he chews on,
	so as to give him something to do for an hour or so. Razz thinks that he can be
	a lap dog and will slowly work his way until he's laying in your lap.
	He's a little big to be a lap dog but he doesn't seem to care. We've gotten him
	to learn how to do paw or shake to recieve a treat. I was the one who taught 
	him that, the rest of my family taught him to "sit pretty" or sit and bring
	both front paws and hold them in the air for a few seconds. He has a habit of
	sniffing everything new that comes through the door as im sure most dogs do,
	along with jumping on anybody new or people who haven't visited in a while.
	He's a very gentle dog other than the slight jumping, when recieving a treat
	he takes it very gently and carefully, unlike some dogs who'll scarf it down 
	while its still inside your hand.

	With my cat on the other hand. He's a fat lazy ball of fur, if your sitting in the
	chair he'll lay down on the armrest next to you, or lay on top of your lap. He'll also manage
	to sneak up behind you causing you to nearly trip when turning around, I swear he does that
	on purpose. He loves laying in the dogs bed and claiming it as his own, or stealing
	the dining room chair and needing to be kicked off at dinner. He also has a problem
	with hiding under my bed for odd reasons. Besides all that, Screech is a good cat
	he won't do things he shouldn't unless no ones home, and he's quite annoying when he wants to be.</p>
