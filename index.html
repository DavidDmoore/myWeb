				The first game in this list and subsequently the first game I've made,
				is Pong. My game of Pong is not the best made but it is still 
				completely playable, and does include ingame sounds but sadly not music.
				The point of the game is most guessably, to score eight points 
				against the other player. Controls are the normal Up and Down arrow
				keys along with W and S, with each corresponding to the paddle on their 
				respective side of the keyboard.
			<br></br>
				My second game that I have made is called Cookie Saga, where the aim 
				of the game is to find and collect every piece of a broken cookie
				in each of the levels. There are only four levels with a basic tutorial 
				incorporated and progressing difficulty. You will also need to avoid any danger 
				in the process that comes from traps and monsters scattered in the levels. 
				The style of the game is a platform jumper and with non-side scrolling elements.
				If you're unfamiliar with what that term, it means that the game sits on a 
				single screen and does not move as you progress the map.
				The character controls will be set to the standard "WASD" keys on the left
				side of the keyboard, making the game playable with a single hand. These
				controls should be standard among many games, and well known and easy to use.
